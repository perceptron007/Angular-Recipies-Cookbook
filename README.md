# Angular-Recipies-Cookbook
The goal of this repo would be to serve as a cookbook for other developers to get help while creating complex components in Angular.


## Angular Recipes

## Appendix

This list will act like a mental model for me to remember what each concept is in term of the technologies described above.
You can also use it as a Q/A format to test your own level of the concepts in Angular, RxJS and functional Programming.
